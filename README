## Linux & Infrastructure Learning

I actively use Linux in virtualized environments to build hands-on experience with system administration and infrastructure operations.

### Current Focus
- Linux server setup and configuration
- Command-line operations and scripting
- Networking basics and troubleshooting
- Automation and workflow efficiency
- System administration fundamentals

This hands-on practice supports my goal of moving toward infrastructure, automation, and security-focused roles.
